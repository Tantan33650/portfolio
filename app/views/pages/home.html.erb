    <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">To start with, I would say that I have a very atypical professional career! <br>
     I first started as an opera singer, training at the Conservatory of Music of Bordeaux and later singing in worldwide stages. After 3 years, I moved to Paris and learned Musical Theater at the International Academy of Musical Theater where I was taugh how to sing, act and dance! Concomitantly to this, I finished my opera training at the Conservatory of Maisons-Alfort. 1 year after both graduations, I decided to move to the Philippines to improve my artistic skills and discover new professional horizons. <br>
    Luckily, it wasn't long until I had the chance to meet the right persons who trained me to become a <strong>consultant in Business Development</strong>, specializing in <strong>Operation Control</strong> (real estate industry) and in <strong>Data analytics</strong> (Stock Market industry), challenging myself everyday and sharpening my logic and my business skills. <br>
    Curious by nature and willing to improve my communication skills, I decided to take an exam which led me to become a <strong>French Teacher</strong> in a Filipino business school (Enderun College). <br>
    As I quickly developed a bigger interest for business and triggered by the high economic growth of the country, I opened up my own 4 employees business, called FrouFrou, selling sweets in one of the largest mall of the Philippines. <br>
    After 4 years living abroad, full of experiences and ideas, I came back to Bordeaux and started to learn how to code in C, curious to know more about the growing tech industry. Quickly realizing that coding was combining my artistic side (front), logical side (back) and my business side, I decided to join <strong>Le Wagon School</strong> Bordeaux where I learned how to properly code in <strong>Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> and use other technologies (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku, Stripe, MapBox, Action Cable, Algolia, Devise, Pundit...). Right after obtaining my <strong>Level 2 RNCP Web Developer Certificate</strong> in September 2019, I started 2 professional projects for Europe and Asia and learned how to code in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. </p>
